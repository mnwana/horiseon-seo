# Horiseon SEO Code Refactor

## What?

A code refactor for the Horiseon Homepage that updates the page structure to include alt values for images and uses proper semantic elements. 
Other updates include adding comments for logical section breaks within index.html and styless.css.

## Why?

Proper use of semantic HTLM, alt elements, and simpler code allows for better accessiblility for screen readers as well as easier knowledge transfer to other developers. As an SEO company, we must also ensure the site is optimized for Search Engine Optimization.
